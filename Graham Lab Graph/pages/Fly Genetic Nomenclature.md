- Genotype of a chromosome is indicated only if there is a mutation or variant on it
- Chromosomes are always listed in the order X/Y, 2, 3, and 4.
- Fly genotypes are always italized
- Mutant names are mostly abbreviated with three or fewer letters
- Lowercase abbreviations indicate recessive phenotypes and uppercase indicate dominants.
- Semicolons separate chromosomes.
- Heterozygosity is denoted by a two-line genotype
- Sometimes a dominant trait is denoted by a superscript D (likely due to loci originally defined by a recessive mutation, but dominant allele was found later)
