- Homologous chromosomes segregate from each other reliably during meiosis
- Dominant markers and balancers for each of the chromosomes indicate the homolog from each parent that the progeny received
- There is no recombination in males and balancer chromosomes effectively suppress recombination with its homolog in females.
